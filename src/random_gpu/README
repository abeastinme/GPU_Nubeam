RANDOM_GPU

GPU Implementation of NTCC random number generator:
To use copy all files in this directory to $nubeam_src_path/random
All of these files should replace the default random number generator.

To Build:
Ensure that all GPU variables are defined, as shown in ../../Docs/exampleshare/Make.local 


This is not needed for nubeam normal operation or for nubeam_gpu operation. This only handles random number generation for the cpu nubeam code.
